Track attendance with ease on the front-end of your site: easy-to-use, self-hosted app including analytics, reports, multiple user access, offline support.

== Description ==

- Vast analytics and 1-touch-adding of new attendees make the process seamless. 
- Each of your staff members can use the Attendance app with their own access PIN.
- We recommend saving the app on the Home Screen of mobile devices for convenience.
- The app stores data locally on the device in the case of an unreliable internet connection.
- Your data is only stored on your WordPress installation as the following post_types: `attendance-day`, `attendance-location`, `attendance-person`, `attendance-staff`
- Receive a Monday morning "Week in Review" email with `csv` attendance files of your locations!

The free version of Attendance is limited to 25 people, 1 location, and 1 staff member. Upgrade today on the Settings page or @ https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=29U2LHYQNAURL!
